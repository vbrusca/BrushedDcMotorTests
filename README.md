# Brushed DC Motor Tests
An analysis of brushed DC motors and propellers used in model aircraft and vehicles.
The purpose of this repository is to collect information about the performance of DC motors so that hobbyists and creators can design better vehicles.
Included in this repository is a spreadsheet with 9 different motors tested against a number of different propellers.
In each test a recording of the max thrust, voltage, amperes, and decibels is made.
You can use the information to find the best brushed DC motor and propeller for your needs.
Also included in this repository are a set of models that were used to build a thrust test stand for small brushed DC motors.

## Test Stand Models
Included are the original CAD files for the brushed DC motor test stands. There are three different pressure arms, for putting pressure on a scale at different heights, included. There are also four motor holders of varying sizes included. The stand can be assembled and disassembled many times over and supports movement in both the pull and push directions. Not every motore has it's own perfect motore holder so find the closest match and use a bit of tape to secure the motor. You should also always secure the wires to help prevent motor twist up and wire damage in the case of motor holder slippage.
