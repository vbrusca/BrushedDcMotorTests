# BrushedDcMotorTests
An analysis of brushed DC motors and propellers used in model aircraft and vehicles.
The purpose of this repository is to collect information about the performance of DC motors so that hobbyists and creators can design better vehicle.
Included in this repository is a spreadsheet with 9 different motors tested against a number of different propellers.
In each test a recording of the max thrust, voltage, amperes, and decibels is made.
You can use the information to find the best brushed DC motor and propeller for your needs.
Also included in this repository are a set of models that were used to build a thrust test stand for small brushed DC motors.
